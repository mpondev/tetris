The goal is to experiment with various ways of programming a Tetris game, each in its branch:

    - tetris-canvas: direct manipulation of the document object through the html canvas element to draw all elements of the game
    - tetris-div: in this case game is rendered through divs instead of canvas drawing
    - tetris-react: use React to program this game through its components
